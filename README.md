# AWESOME WM MODULAR CONFIG
Inspired by Curt Spark's [Linux AwesomeWM Modular Starter Kit](https://gitlab.com/bloxiebird/linux-awesomewm-modular-starter-kit) and Epsi's notes on [Awesome WM Modularized Structure](http://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2019/06/15/awesome-overview.html).

## Current features
* It's modular, or at least it tries to be.
* Includes streetturtle's [ToDo Widget](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/todo-widget)
	* Because of this, it also uses rxi's [json.lua](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua). **See note at the end of this readme.**

## Planned features
* Make a proper color scheme or theme
* Add a way to autostart programs on user login
* Find a way to customize tags, rules, and other properties without going into the config files
* Check if I didn't make too much spaghetti ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

_**Note:** I didn't bother with git submodules, nor did I research how to give proper credit to those who made the pieces of code I  took from other repositories. This is mainly for personal use and for learning purposes._
